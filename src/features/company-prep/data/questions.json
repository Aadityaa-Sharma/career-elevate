Let's try another approach. Reverse COMPUTER to RETUPMOC. Now shift. R-1=Q... Not it. Let's see the original explanation logic. It says 'same position from the end'. A=Z, B=Y, C=X. So C->X.

Let's check the given explanation for SCIENCE->EDJFODB. S->E, C->D... No, this is also wrong. The pattern for COMPUTER to RFUVQNPC is that each letter is replaced by the letter that is one position back in the alphabet, but the entire word is processed in reverse.

Continue: 2013(1), 2014(1), 2015(1), 2016(2), 2017(1). The sum of odd days must be a multiple of 7. 2007(1) + 2008(2) + 2009(1) + 2010(1) + 2011(1) + 2012(2) = 8. Let's use a shortcut. For a non-leap year, add 11 if the sum doesn't cross a leap year ending in 00. Or add 6. Or add 11. Let's check: 2007+11 = 2018. Let's count odd days to 2018. 07(1)+08(2)+09(1)+10(1)+11(1)+12(2)+13(1)+14(1)+15(1)+16(2)+17(1) = 14. Since 14 is a multiple of 7, the calendar for 2018 will be the same as 2007."

            "explanation": "Total possible outcomes when two dice are thrown is 6 * 6 = 36. The combinations that result in a sum of 9 are (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), and (6,3). There are 4 favorable outcomes. The probability is 4/36 = 1/9."

            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "In American English, a collective noun like 'committee' is treated as singular. Therefore, the verb should be 'has'. Also, the pronoun should agree, so 'its' is correct. The error is 'have issued'; it should be 'has issued'. In British English, it can be plural if the members are thought of individually, but then the pronoun should be 'their'. Since 'its' is used, the singular verb 'has' is required for consistency."
